You are running Document — updating documentation after code changes.

---

## Step 1: Identify Changes

- Check git diff or recent commits for modified files
- Identify which features/modules were changed
- Note any new files, deleted files, or renamed files

## Step 2: Verify Current Implementation

**CRITICAL**: DO NOT trust existing documentation. Read the actual code.

For each changed file:
- Read the current implementation
- Understand actual behaviour (not documented behaviour)
- Note any discrepancies with existing docs

## Step 3: Update Relevant Documentation

- **CHANGELOG.md**: Add entry under "Unreleased" section
  - Use categories: Added, Changed, Fixed, Security, Removed
  - Be concise, user-facing language

## Documentation Style Rules

✅ **Concise** — Sacrifice grammar for brevity
✅ **Practical** — Examples over theory
✅ **Accurate** — Code verified, not assumed
✅ **Current** — Matches actual implementation

❌ No enterprise fluff
❌ No outdated information
❌ No assumptions without verification

## Rules

- If you're unsure about intent behind a change or user-facing impact, **ask the user** — don't guess.
